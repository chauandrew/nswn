GPLA New Student Welcome Night site. 


## Introduction

Hi friends! We're using React/Nodejs for our site. Other details are still in the works. 


## Getting Started

The `client` folder hosts the react front end, and the `server` folder hosts 
the backend. 

Before anything else, you'll need to install npm. 

To run the frontend server, go to the `client` folder in a terminal and run

    `npm install`

in order to install the needed packages. Then, to run the front end server, run

    `npm start`

The application window should automatically open in a browser! If it doesn't, 
navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in a browser and you'll see the application!

Similarly, you can run the backend service by going into the `service` directory,
running `npm install` to install packages, and then running `npm run-scripts dev`.
